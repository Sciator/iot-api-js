# iot-api-js

This project is an example NextJS (NodeJS and React) application that uses the InfluxDB API client library for Javascript.
The application is an adaptation of [InfluxData IoT Center](https://github.com/bonitoo-io/iot-center-v2), intentionally simplified to accompany the InfluxData IoT Starter tutorial.

## Features

This application demonstrates how you can use InfluxDB client libraries to do the following:

- Create and manage InfluxDB authorizations (API tokens and permissions).
- Write and query device metadata in InfluxDB.
- Write and query telemetry data in InfluxDB.
- Generate data visualizations with the InfluxDB UI libraries.

## Credits

Based on the [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) starter template and [InfluxData IoT Center](https://github.com/bonitoo-io/iot-center-v2).
